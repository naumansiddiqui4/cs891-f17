\section{Introduction}
The report describes about creating collections on Archive-It, Webrecoder, WAIL, WARCreate. It explains about the experience of creating collections on each of the four different tools, compares them over their advantages and disadvantages for each other. It also explains about the tools in terms of capture,quality and ease of use. This report also highlights on the importance of building this collection and description of seeds in measuring the use of the collection.

\section{Webrecorder}
URL of the Collection\\
\url{https://webrecorder.io/naumansiddiqui4/2014-indian-parliamentary-elections}\\
The collection was initially built with sixteen seeds but now it contains twentyseven bookmarks. It has a collection size of 147.55 MB. It was my first collection and was fairly easy to build. It required me to just paste the seeds one after the other in the Webrecoder's Bookmark Bar. It has a very simple user interface which displays all the necessary informations like the seeds list and timestamp for the creation of the seed, original URL and the bookmarks show a detailed description of each seed.

This seed has been captured with all the resources. It is a scrollable page with a number of news on the single page.There issue related with the capture of this seed is it flickers a lot. The page turns blank and then reappers with the data and it happens after every few seconds.

This seed has been captured with all the resources.The capture is perfectly fine with no issueapart from some advertisements missing but they are not of our concern.

This seed has captured the page but none of the links on the page work. The purpose of the seed was to archive Election Commission of India pages containing 2014 Parliamentary Election results but Webrecorder captured the URL and none of its outlinks. This capture is not a useful one.

This seed has all the resources captured except for the videos in the news article. They just keep buffering and after sometime become unresponsive and do not even accept the play and pause commands.

This seed has all the resources captured except for a resource missing in the Google comment section. But the missing resource is not of any importance, so it being missing does not effect the relevance of the capture.

This seed is a new article in three parts with part one being the seed URL and rest two parts can be traversed using the links on the page. Webrecorder has crawled all the three parts of the story and displays them as separate bookmarks in the user webpage. All the three individual bookmarks have all the resources but if we navigate to Article Three from the link provided in the Article One, the CSS and Images of the page go missing. It is very strange as on one snapshot webrecorder has all the resources for the page while navigating it through a link, it misses key resources.

This seed is a website on Gujrat Riots but none of the links on the webpage work making this seed almost useless. Even the slider of images on the original URL do not contain all the images when viewed in full screen.

\subsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of Webrecorder}
Advantages of Webrecorder:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is easy to use with just pasting the seed URLs in the Webrecorder's bookmark bar.
\item It has a very simple webpage with all the useful information in one place.
\item It is very efficient at recording single page seeds. It has an almost 100 p\% accuracy in capturing the contents for a single page.
\item It is very useful when while surfing the internet you want to record any intresting URL.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages of Webrecorder:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is very poor at capturing seeds which require crawling for related pages. It almost never crawls for the page outside the seed URL which makes it useless for archiving related pages.
\item It did not capture the video and images for somepages which makes it unpredictable for pages containing images and videos.
\item It makes the user paste single URL at a time unlike Archive-It which is a slight tedious process.
\end{itemize}
\section{Archive-It}
URL of the Collection\\
\url{https://partner.archive-it.org/536/collections/9543}\\
The collection has fifteen seeds with a collection size of 91.9 GB and 2,362,468 documents. Thirteen of fifteen seeds are page only crawl and the rest two are standard crawls. The initial crawl frequency for all the pages was daily but it was later changed to weekly after a week. I faced an error while navigating in the Archive-It, the screenshot for the error have been attached.

\subsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of Archive-It}
Advantages of Archive-It:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is a standard web-archiving tool to create your own personalized as well as public collection.
\item It is very useful in standard crawl unlike Webrecorder. 
\item It captures the modifications made to the seeds over the time by setting up a crawl frequency which is a very useful way of showing changes to a page.
\item It has a multiple seed URL paste option which makes the work easy for the end users.
\item It is very useful when you building a collection which needs to be crawled after specific time for checking on the modifications to the page.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages of Archive-It:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is very poor at pages which have javascript on the webpage. I feel it is a limitation of their Heretrix crawl engine.
\item It did not capture the video and images for somepages which makes it unpredictable for pages containing images and videos.
\item For some captures it displayed me an error without any content which are hard to understand for any naive user.
\end{itemize}
\section{WAIL}
I am running WAIL on Windows. It took me some time to setup for the first time, but it runs perfectly fine if I run the executable with administrator privileges. It lists eighteen seeds with a size of 103 MB.

\subsubsection{Seed 3}
The seed has one capture. It was a standard same domain only crawl. None of the links on the page work, but I have no idea are they on the same domain. The capture has all the contents but misses the slider images.

\subsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of WAIL}
Advantages of WAIL:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is easy to use with just pasting the seed URLs in the add seed URL.
\item It has a very simple webpage with all the useful information in one place.
\item It is very efficient at recording single page seeds. It has an almost 100 p\% accuracy in capturing the contents for a single page.
\item It is very useful for building personal archives.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages of WAIL:
\begin{itemize}
\item A few captures just threw error on treplaying them in pywayback.
\item It is very poor at capturing seeds which require crawling for related pages. It almost never crawls for the page outside the seed URL which makes it useless for archiving related pages.
\item It did not capture the video and images for somepages which makes it unpredictable for pages containing images and videos.
\item It makes the user paste single URL at a time unlike Archive-It which is a slight tedious process.
\item It uses a multi-threaded approach to run each crawl in a separate thread which takes a toll on the performance of a personal machine.
\end{itemize}
\section{WARCreate}
It is very slow to respond in generating WARCs. It makes me feel very unpredictable of when the page is going to have a WARC.
\subsection{Review of  Seeds}
\subsubsection{Seed 1}
The warc file has one memento which on replaying in WAIL shows a pywayback error.

\subsubsection{Seed 3}
The warc file has one memento which on replaying in WAIL shows all the resources. This page was supposed to be a standard crawl but WARCreate does not support it, so it is good for nothing seed.

\subsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of WAIL}
Advantages of WAIL:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is easy to use with just a click of button as Google Chrome extention.

\end{itemize}
Disadvantages of WAIL:
\begin{itemize}
\item It did not capture all the seeds.
\item It takes long time in generating WARCs and most times it is not responsive making the user wondering about its functioning.
\item It is the poorest tool we are using to build this collection.
\item Even its replay does not have a satisfactory result.
\end{itemize}
\section{Highlights of the Collection}
The fifteen seeds are just a glimpse about the series of event that unfolded before and after the 2014 Parliamentary Elections. This collection can help a user understand the basics functioning of Indian Democracy. It sheds light on the 2014 Parliamentary Elections campaign and results. It also shows why this election was considered a turning point in Indian politics. It shows how a candidate with such a genocide behind his name becomes Prime Minister in a secular nation of India.
